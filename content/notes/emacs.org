#+title: emacs

Some notes regarding my ~emacs~ usage. Mostly for my future self, but if you
find anything useful feel free to take it!

* Including dot diagrams with org-babel

** Add ~dot~ to the list of src lang modes

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes (quote ("dot" . graphviz-dot)))
#+END_SRC

** Include the diagram in any document

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file diagram.png
digraph G {
        main -> parse -> execute;
        main -> init;
        main -> cleanup;
        execute -> make_string;
        execute -> printf
        init -> make_string;
        main -> printf;
        execute -> compare;
}
,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

** Disable confirmation of dot evaluation

When generating the contents in an unattended mode it's good to let
~emacs~ know that it's fine to evaluate the dot contents. We can avoid
the confirmation by setting:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+END_SRC
